  - "Employees, \n \n  As CEO of DDB TV for over ten years, it pains me to announce that
    I will be retiring from my position by the end of this year\u2026 TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT!
    That\u2019s right everyone! I am leaving DDB to pursue even greater success as
    a politician. Be sure to vote for me when election day comes! My friends and I
    got a feeling that it\u2019ll be a piece of cake. When you\u2019re at the ballot
    box this November, remember to vote for your old pal, Ry-URR-n! \n \n  [SIGNATURE.JPEG]\n
    -- Ry-URRR-n Ryanson  \n  DDE TV CEO  \n  Republican Presidential nominee "
  - "Hey all,  \n \n  In light of Mr. Ryanson\u2019s recent performance review, as well as
    the office chirophilia scandal that was leaked to the public, I would like to
    announce my temporary move to interim CEO of DDE Television. I know this must
    come to a shock to a number of employees, but as the one closest within Mr. Ryanson\u2019s
    inner circle, I was decided to be the most capable dino to watch over the company
    during this transition. \n\n  Chad \n Genesis 1:31-35 \n Go Raptors! \n Stegosarus and proud "
  - "Hey bud,  \n \n  Terry from acquisitions here. Turns out your content curation has really
    upped those pterosaur ratings. They are now our NUMBER ONE audience. Hell yeah,
    my dude. Yesterday, corporate came to me with a promotion offer for a director
    position \u2018cuz a that. 
    \  Anyone, I want to use this new power to push for a union! What I need you to do is get all the human workers
    together to sign petitions for it. It\u2019s a bit risky...signers could get fired...but
    that\u2019s whyy I thought humans might be up to it? \n\n WE GOT THE POWER, \n \n  Terry [your future
    benevolent dictator ;)]"
  - "Human,  \n\n  I\u2019m looking at our tracking software today. I think you have a grave
    misunderstanding of what exactly APE means. Funny, considering you are one.  APE
    means \u201Calways please everybody.\u201D And I am not pleased.  I understand
    we asked you to balance out the audience ratings. I understand that sometimes,
    that means \u201Cfailing\u201D on purpose.  But this is beyond the pale.  You
    have not curated a SINGLE show that we\u2019ve asked you to. We could have placed
    an mop bucket at your desk and gotten the same results.  So why should I bother
    paying you?  Tell you what. You\u2019re not fired. Yet. Just...reprimanded.   Come
    to my house tonight. We\u2019ll be having you for dinner.  \n Ryanson "
