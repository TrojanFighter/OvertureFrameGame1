  _emailBody:
  - "Saying hi to my little ones!11! :3  Hey, new hire! We\u2019re so happy to have
    you join our junior content curation team today. I know you have dreams of creating
    one day, but we do have to start small (like you :D!) And this position is just
    perfect for you, what with those useful little thumbys of yours.  I know you got
    the spiel already- didn\u2019t you just LOVE my outfit?- so I\u2019ll let you
    get to it. Just remember to edit the content so the audience ratings are balanced
    out, and you should be fine! "
  - "Yo, buddy! I\u2019m just sending this out to make sure that you\u2019ve signed
    up for the mandatory company life insurance? No rush, but we do require it of
    every human worker here at DDB. Just in case of little on-the-job whoopsies!  Try
    to get it to me by Friday, ok?  Counting on u, "
  - "Hewwooooooo! I\u2019m noticing that you still haven\u2019t signed up for life
    insurance yet? We really DO need that before we can send you your pay, so please
    fill it out! Or else I can\u2019t pay you, dear! It really is your own fault if
    groceries are a bit tight this week, haha!  If you need someone to help read it
    to you, or explain it to you, let me know, ok? We offer accommodations for all...skill
    levels here.  Also, I\u2019ve received your complaint about harassment. I\u2019ll
    be in touch later. "
  - "Human! Human! I have some good news for you. I\u2019ve spoken with the velociraptor
    who kept threatening to eat you, Gary, great guy, and I got him to admit he did
    it! Aren\u2019t you proud of me? So, next, we\u2019re gonna need you to engage
    in mandatory sensitivity training, to help prepare you for those kind of comments.
    After that, they shouldn\u2019t hurt anymore! It\u2019s important to fit into
    the company culture.  By the way, the casual fall formal mixer BLASTATHON is coming
    up! I hope you have a date in mind? "
  - "Human, I heard that you invited a duckbill to the fall formal? That\u2019s not
    allowed! Maybe it\u2019s my fault? Was I not clear enough?  The fall formal is
    a human only activity! We get you all dressed up in those cute little outfits
    and pair you up with each other and take pictures! It\u2019s so cute :3! The dinosaur
    employees are only there to observe, not participate.  Jim\u2019s decided not
    to complain about you asking him, though, so you\u2019re fine for now. Lucky you!
    \ Try to be careful about office etiquette for as long as you still work here,
    ok? "
  - "Human,  I\u2019m hearing that you performed adequately on censoring out the hip
    hop music video today. The pterosaurs can\u2019t stand that shit, think it\u2019s
    corny, so good job on upping their rating with us. Seems like we\u2019ve lost
    a few points with the stegos, though. They like corny. Still, you did as asked,
    so I can\u2019t be...too...mad. I\u2019ve been told to be more lenient on the
    first day.  Get back to work! "
