  _emailBody:
  - "Welcome to the first day on the job, [EMPLOYEE FIRST NAME].\n\nI am so excited
    to have you on our team! You and your set of \u201Cskills\u201D are a valuable
    addition to our company, and we hope you enjoy your time working for us!  As a
    junior content creator, your job is to use your unique \u201Cskills\u201D and
    apply them to our state of the art censorshi- I mean, curation software. We have
    millions of different types of dinosaurs watching our shows at any given time,
    and we want to make sure we\u2019re giving them everything they want, and nothing
    they don\u2019t.  If you ever have questions, feel free to email me at [MY WORK
    EMAIL], and if you have any concerns or complaints about your work environment,
    feel free to contact our HR representative, [CURRENT HR REP FIRST NAME] at [HR
    EMAIL]  Just remember our company policy: APE. ALWAYS. PLEASE. EVERYBODY. Remember,
    APE. Like you!   [SIGNATURE.JPEG] -- Ry-URRR-n Ryanson    DDE TV CEO "
  - "Hey, new hire! \n\n We\u2019re so happy to have you join our junior content curation
    team today. I know you have dreams of creating one day, but we do have to start
    small (like you :D!) And this position is just perfect for you, what with those
    useful little thumbys of yours.  I know you got the spiel already- didn\u2019t
    you just LOVE my outfit?- so I\u2019ll let you get to it. Just remember to edit
    the content so the audience ratings are balanced out, and you should be fine!"
  - 'Employee,Your session has expired. We cannot grant you access to this account
    until you re-authenticate. Please pass this quick CAPCHA. '
  - "Hey junior, \n\n I need you to man the live censor software today. We got a children\u2019s
    show that\u2019s gotten a little bit too liberal with their content and I don\u2019t
    want a bunch of angry parents pounding down my door because some hack animators
    wanted to be \u201CProgressive\u201D. All you have to do is use the arrow keys
    to keep pants on the animated dino, and leave the screen when the dino's not on.Our
    Stegosaurus audiences will be grateful. But hey, if you mess up, we can always
    just say that the show was meant for Pterosaurs."
  - "Yo, buddy! \n\n I\u2019m just sending this out to make sure that you\u2019ve
    signed up for the mandatory company life insurance? No rush, but we do require
    it of every human worker here at DDB. Just in case of little on-the-job whoopsies!
    \ Try to get it to me by Friday, ok?"
  - "Hewwooooooo! \n\n I\u2019m noticing that you still haven\u2019t signed up for
    life insurance yet? We really DO need that before we can send you your pay, so
    please fill it out! Or else I can\u2019t pay you, dear! It really is your own
    fault if groceries are a bit tight this week, haha!  If you need someone to help
    read it to you, or explain it to you, let me know, ok? We offer accommodations
    for all...skill levels here.  Also, I\u2019ve received your complaint about harassment.
    I\u2019ll be in touch later."
  - "You\u2019ve been doing a good job with your soft, dainty, human hands, so I don\u2019t
    really want to give you an assignment in public media contribution, but it\u2019s
    Easter and all the humies have gone home to go egg hunting (gross) Anyway, we
    take a bunch of social media comments and air them on our shows, everything\u2019s
    automated. It\u2019s the internet though, and if we aired all the comments about
    our shows marketing will be on my tail for weeks. Just drag the appropriate comments
    into the \u201CShow comment\u201D Field, drag any crappy comments to the \u201CHide
    comment\u201D field.  Our Pterosaur audiences will appreciate your efforts. No
    one will ever know what you\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s the thought that counts.
    I meean, as a T-Rex, I think it\u2019s stupid we even have someone doing this.
    But that\u2019s just me.  "

    to be? \n It happens to dinosaurs all over the world but there is a new FDA approved

  - "Hey newbie, \n\n  Chad from marketing here, wondering if you\u2019d like to put
    some money in for the bracket we got going for the Dinosaur Basketball championships.
    $25 and a bracket by Monday and you\u2019re in.   Oh, by the way, thanks for the
    heads up the other day about Ry-URR-n, that guy\u2019s a jerk. I owe you one (He
    nearly got a chunk of me), let me know if you need anything. Us corporate drones
    gotta stick together, right?  "
  - People on the internet are bastards, aren't they? Great job.

  - "Hey new hire, \n\n  Terry from acquisitions here. I know, I know. Random pterosaur
    messaging you on your first day? No worries, I\u2019m not gonna fly off with you,
    haha. I\u2019m just putting together a karaoke get-together tonight, was wondering
    if you wanted in? It\u2019ll just be a few of us from across the station. Down
    at the place across the street, you know that one? We wouuuuld need you to leave
    your post about a half hour early though, you ok with that?  I just know Bronto-bore-us
    and the boss can be a bit much, wanted to reach out a friendly claw. "
  - "You\u2019re going to be on the news beat today. You know Chet Growlmnd? Great
    person, lots of charisma, brain the size of a peanut, which is perfect, since
    they\u2019ll basically say anything they read on the teleprompter without thinking
    about it. Bad news is, this got out somehow into the world and now some kids hacked
    the teleprompter. Thankfully we got the boys over in IT to cook up something to
    take care of it. Just use the keyboard to input the green words, you\u2019ll know
    when you\u2019ve replaced a problem word when it turns blue.   Just do your job
    and it\u2019ll look like nothing happened. If you don\u2019t\u2026 Well, other
    than me having you over for dinner for a stern talking to, We have to tell all
    of our T-Rex clients that the whole thing was an experiment to attract Stegosarus
    audiences. If marketing come to my office I\u2019m going to push them over to
    you so you can explain why everything got fucked up"
  - "Human! Human! \n\n I have some good news for you. I\u2019ve spoken with the velociraptor
    who kept threatening to eat you, Daryl, great guy, and I got him to admit he did
    it! Aren\u2019t you proud of me? So, next, we\u2019re gonna need you to engage
    in mandatory sensitivity training, to help prepare you for those kind of comments.
    After that, they shouldn\u2019t hurt anymore! It\u2019s important to fit into
    the company culture.  By the way, the casual fall formal mixer BLASTATHON is coming
    up! I hope you have a date in mind?  Wear something cute!, Bronto-bore-us "
  - "Ry-urr-n just fired my girlfriend! What the fuck?!!! Apparently he has some rule
    about no human makeup products? She just had a dented scale, thought a little
    concealer could help! TOO FAR! I\u2019m going to Bronto-bore-us, you with me? "
  - Way to prevent all that fake news! We'll take it from here.
  - "Time again for your favorite activity: moderating user comments! This time they\u2019re
    gonna be watching some old human flick about dinosaurs and cowboys, I don\u2019t
    give a shit. But be prepared for some offended assholes out there. Those T-Rexes
    don\u2019t like being depicted as idiots (suppose they\u2019re afraid of the truth).
    Stegos do love human culture, though\u2026  \t- Ryanson "

  - Way to prevent all that fake news! We'll take it from here.
  - "Human, \n\n You remember the censor bar assignment, right? From that crappy kid\u2019s
    show? Yeah, we\u2019re gonna need you to do that shit again, but this time on
    some new age rock and roll crap. Stegos are super into this band, makes those
    crusty elites feel hip and new. Dunno how the pteros feel about it, though.   Ryanson "
  - "Man, man, mannnn! The meeting with Ry-urr-n did NOT go well. Little disappointed
    you weren\u2019t there, bro! I get it, I get it, you\u2019re new though. You\u2019re
    scared. Plus you\u2019re a polydacty- I mean, human. It must be rough for you.
    But I know how you can make it up to me.  I\u2019m leading a walkout starting
    TOMORROW. We are gonna STRIKE until this office gets some fairer conditions and
    an actual competent HR manager.  We need some sign-holders. Don\u2019t let me
    down, dude!  See you TOMORROW, OUTSIDE! "
  - "Human, \n\n I heard that you invited a duckbill to the fall formal? That\u2019s
    not allowed! Maybe it\u2019s my fault? Was I not clear enough?  The fall formal
    is a human only activity! We get you all dressed up in those cute little outfits
    and pair you up with each other and take pictures! It\u2019s so cute :3! The dinosaur
    employees are only there to observe, not participate.  Jim\u2019s decided not
    to complain about you asking him, though, so you\u2019re fine for now. Lucky you!
    \ Try to be careful about office etiquette for as long as you still work here,
    ok?  Formally, Ms. Bronto-bore-us "
  - There was a lot of shit in those comments, glad to have you to sort them out.
  - Not bad at all. Just try harder next time, ok?
