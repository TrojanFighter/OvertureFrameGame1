  _emailBody:
  - "Hello [EMPLOYEE FIRST NAME],  Welcome to the first day on the job, [EMPLOYEE
    FIRST NAME]. I am so excited to have you on our team! You and your set of \u201Cskills\u201D
    are a valuable addition to our company, and we hope you enjoy your time working
    for us!  If you ever have questions, feel free to email me at [MY WORK EMAIL],
    and if you have any concerns or complaints about your work environment, feel free
    to contact our HR representative, [CURRENT HR REP FIRST NAME] at [HR EMAIL]"
  - "Hey, new hire! We\u2019re so happy to have you join our junior content curation
    team today. I know you have dreams of creating one day, but we do have to start
    small (like you :D!) And this position is just perfect for you, what with those
    useful little thumbys of yours.  I know you got the spiel already- didn\u2019t
    you just LOVE my outfit?- so I\u2019ll let you get to it. Just remember to edit
    the content so the audience ratings are balanced out, and you should be fine!"
  - "Hey junior,  I need you to man the live censor software today. We got a children\u2019s
    show that\u2019s gotten a little bit too liberal with their content and I don\u2019t
    want a bunch of angry parents pounding down my door because some hack animators
    wanted to be \u201CProgressive\u201D. All you have to do is use the mouse to keep
    pants on the animated dino.Our Stegosaurus audiences will be grateful. But hey,
    if you mess up, we can always just say that the show was meant for Pterosaurs.
    Just do the best you can do."
  - "Yo, buddy! I\u2019m just sending this out to make sure that you\u2019ve signed
    up for the mandatory company life insurance? No rush, but we do require it of
    every human worker here at DDB. Just in case of little on-the-job whoopsies!  Try
    to get it to me by Friday, ok?"
  - "Hewwooooooo! I\u2019m noticing that you still haven\u2019t signed up for life
    insurance yet? We really DO need that before we can send you your pay, so please
    fill it out! Or else I can\u2019t pay you, dear! It really is your own fault if
    groceries are a bit tight this week, haha!  If you need someone to help read it
    to you, or explain it to you, let me know, ok? We offer accommodations for all...skill
    levels here.  Also, I\u2019ve received your complaint about harassment. I\u2019ll
    be in touch later."
  - "Hey newbie,  Chad from marketing here, wondering if you\u2019d like to put some
    money in for the bracket we got going for the Dinosaur Basketball championships.
    $25 and a bracket by Monday and you\u2019re in.   Oh, by the way, thanks for the
    heads up the other day about Ry-URR-n, that guy\u2019s a jerk. I owe you one (He
    nearly got a chunk of me), let me know if you need anything. Us corporate drones
    gotta stick together, right?  "
